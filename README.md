Special Thanks: My trainer Tarif Ezaz and my friend Mohammad Abdullah Matin Khan Zarzis to whom I learned to think.

I also want to mention some of the other special names for their tremendous support. Nafis Ahmed, Mohammad Samiul Islam, Zobayer Hasan, Forhad Ahmed and Leonardo Boshell

NOTE : I don't claim all of the soutions to be mine. While I was solving the problems, I took help from different peoples and see other people's code for many problems. In Fact most of the coder here is collected. But I never submit any code without my complete understanding. I suugest those who will be following the repo to do so. Pasting code to online judges won't take you any further except frustration.
